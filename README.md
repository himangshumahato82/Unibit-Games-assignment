Input:

arr: [1, 3, 2, 2, -4, -6, -2, 8]
target: 4
Initialize variables:

arr1: []
mergedArr: []
arr2: []
doubledTarget: 8
Find the first combinations:

Iterate over the elements of arr using two nested loops.
If the sum of two elements equals the target, add the pair [arr[i], arr[j]] to arr1.
After the iteration, arr1 contains the first combinations: [[1, 3], [2, 2], [-4, 8], [-6, 2]].
Merge the array and sort it:

Copy the elements of arr to mergedArr using the spread operator.
Sort mergedArr in ascending order: [-6, -4, -2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 8].
Find the second combinations:

Call the recursive function findSecondCombination with initial values: startIndex = 0, arr1 = [], curSum = 0.
Inside findSecondCombination, check if the curSum is equal to the doubledTarget (8).
If it is, add a copy of arr1 to arr2.
Otherwise, iterate over the remaining elements of mergedArr starting from startIndex.
If the current sum (curSum + num) is less than or equal to doubledTarget, add num to arr1 and make a recursive call to findSecondCombination with an updated startIndex, arr1, and curSum.
After the iteration, arr2 contains the second combinations.
Return the result:

Return an array containing arr1, mergedArr, and arr2.
Output:

First Combination For '4': [[1, 3], [2, 2], [-4, 8], [-6, 2]]
Merge Into a single Array: [-6, -4, -2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 8]
Second Combination For '8': [[1, 3, 2, 2], [8, -4, 2, 2], ...] (multiple combinations)
